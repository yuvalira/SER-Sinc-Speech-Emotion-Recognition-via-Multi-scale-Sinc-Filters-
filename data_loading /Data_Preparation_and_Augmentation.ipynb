It includes mono conversion, resampling to 16kHz, normalization, and fixed-length trimming or padding. To improve model robustness, a custom emotion-aware augmentation pipeline is applied to the training set only, generating three additional augmented versions per sample using label-specific transformations (e.g., pitch shift, noise injection). All processed samples are saved as .pt files. The final dataset is zipped and exported to Google Drive.\n"
